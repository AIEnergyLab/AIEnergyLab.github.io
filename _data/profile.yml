    The energy system is undergoing a significant transition towards low-carbon sustainability, characterized by the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources, 
    such as wind and solar power, to replace conventional coal-fired thermal generation. However, the inherent uncertainty and intermittency of renewable generation pose major challenges in achieving a smooth transition. 
    In traditional energy systems, coal-fired plants can be adjusted flexibly to balance demand. In contrast, renewable energy output is heavily influenced by weather conditions, 
    leading to fluctuations that often misalign with energy demands.
  </p>
  <p>
    To address this, our mission is to explore smart coordination between supply and demand, leveraging advanced tools for the intelligent operation of energy systems. 
    Our generation has witnessed rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly the strong representational capabilities of neural networks, 
    which enable data mining, time-series prediction, decision-making, and the resolution of complex optimization problems.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our team is dedicated to investigating the application of AI technologies in energy system modeling, optimization, and decision-making, tackling the challenges associated with the transition to a low-carbon energy future.
